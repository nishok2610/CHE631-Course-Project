Course : CHE631; Mentor: Prof. Animangsu Ghatak, CHE, IIT Kanpur

• Studied the effect of catalyst deactivation on batch reactor performance.
• Built mathematical models for reaction and catalyst decay.
• Used MATLAB simulations to compare conversion with and without catalyst decay.
• Analyzed how catalyst stability affects conversion and reactor efficiency.
• Suggested ways to optimize catalyst use and reactor operation.
